title: About this blog
---

<p>
I was inspired to start my blog by Mr. Nguyen Dinh Dang - a nuclear physicist. Mr. Dang is a unique figure in the world of art and science. He is a talented artist who is also a respected physicist. His work bridges the gap between these two disciplines, and he is a role model for others who are interested in pursuing a career in both art and science. I have always dreamed of becoming an engineer and an artist at the same time. I wanna use this blog to archive all the things I learned in my journey.
