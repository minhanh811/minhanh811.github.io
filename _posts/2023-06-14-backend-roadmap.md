title: Backend Developer Roadmap
---

<p>
A couple of years ago, I found myself consumed by a burning question: How does one learn programming from scratch? With no prior experience or formal training in the field, the prospect seemed daunting. I remember a time when I attempted to guide a family member in learning programming. I quickly realized that effective teaching involves more than technical knowledge and enthusiasm. Besides that, it requires a curriculum, and a roadmap, to provide structure and direction. Unfortunately, at that time, I didn't have access to such resources, leaving me to face a disheartening setback.

One day I discovered [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) This is exactly what I want: a comprehensive and well-structured roadmap for everyone. Roadmap.sh offers comprehensive and organized learning paths that cover everything from web development and data science to DevOps and mobile app development. I have just completed the Backend Developer at **Roadmap**. I hope that the next time somebody comes to me seeking advice on how to become a software engineer, I will be armed with the knowledge and resources to guide them effectively.
