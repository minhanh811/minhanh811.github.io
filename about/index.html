<p>
<img src="/avatar.jpg" class="about-avatar" /> My name is Duong Anh Minh. I am a Ruby on Rails backend developer, gamer, and toys collector.
</p>

<p>
I've worked as a backend developer for the past 5 years in Deliveree Logistics Vietnam. I really love this place because I can be both productive and playful. There are a lot of valuable experiences and professional growth I have gained here.

<p>
I have a bicycle, My commute to work is about 1 kilometer, so I usually cycle to work. It takes me about 15 minutes each way. I like riding because it is a great way to get exercise and it make me very comfortable.
</p>

<p>
I listen to music every day and enjoy drawing sometimes when I have the time. Music doesn't leave anyone behind. I believe music saved my soul. I used to draw when I was a kid. Lucky me, I'm still drawing.

<p>
I like to read. I think books help me build my own character by helping me to understand myself and the world around me.

I use this space to share my thoughts surrounding these topics.

Hey, don't be sad.
